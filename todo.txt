goals for tommorow:
currently using names of units to send commands, 
we gotta figure out how to get the id from the state sync node to pass to the network.

Prob fix how calling give_command works: currently client calls on unit, but server calls on selectable.

back burner:
simple state machine, theres a file in scripts

Notes:
if you sync player views and selctions, just make a player node and sync thoes
