goals for tommorow:
add node/class for syncing an objects network state, name it like "networked_object" or something.
Have it read from the reasource we made and set properites from their, 
that way we can just slap it on each networked object and have it take carte of itself.

back burner:
simple state machine, theres a file in scripts

Notes:
if you sync player views and selctions, just make a player node and sync thoes
